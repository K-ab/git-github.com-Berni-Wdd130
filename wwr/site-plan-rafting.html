    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Your rafting will be directed by our inflatable boat. You will pass through passages with large volumes of water, rapids and many other small "obstacles" during your raft descent. The only prerequisite to enjoy the sensations of Rafting is to know how to swim at least 20 meters! More than putting on your swimsuit and starting this refreshing activity while exploring the "San Pedro" region, you also need to be in good general physical condition.</p>
